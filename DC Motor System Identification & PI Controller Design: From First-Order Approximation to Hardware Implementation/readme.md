This lab involved modeling a DC motor’s velocity response using a first-order transfer function approximation, validated through Simulink simulations and hardware experiments. After filtering noisy raw data with a low-pass filter (LPF), I derived the system’s gain (𝐾 = 13.75) and time constant (𝜏 = 0.131) via MATLAB analysis, achieving a transfer function of 𝑌(𝑠) = 13.75/(0.131𝑠 + 1). I then designed three PI controllers, tuning coefficients (𝐾ₚ, 𝐾ᵢ) to meet strict criteria (0% steady-state error, <8% overshoot, <0.8s settling time), and implemented the optimal controller on hardware. The final design achieved 0% overshoot and 0.41s settling time, with minor hardware-simulation discrepancies due to noise. This project demonstrated my proficiency in system identification, control theory, and embedded systems integration, combining MATLAB/Simulink modeling with real-world validation.
