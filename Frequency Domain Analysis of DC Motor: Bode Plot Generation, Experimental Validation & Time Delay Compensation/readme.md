This lab focused on frequency-domain system identification of a DC motor, beginning with generating theoretical Bode plots from the transfer function found in lab 1 using MATLAB, while deliberately avoiding the built-in bode function to demonstrate manual computation skills. By applying sinusoidal inputs at varying frequencies (0.1–100 rad/s) to the physical motor, I captured experimental data, processed it via FFT to extract magnitude and phase responses, and overlaid these results (marked as 'x') onto the theoretical Bode plot for validation. To address hardware-induced phase discrepancies, I incorporated a first-order Padé approximation to model a 10 ms processing delay, refining the transfer function. This project showcased my ability to bridge theoretical modeling (Laplace domain analysis) with practical hardware experimentation, while employing advanced MATLAB scripting (FFT, semilogx) and control theory concepts (Padé approximation, frequency response) to achieve accurate system identification.
